## Hi there,
-  Welcome to Jonathan's portfolio page.

## Who Am I?
- I am a ~~DevOps~~ "DevOops" / Infrastructure Engineer focused on AWS technologies.

- As you can see from this website, I am definitely not a front-end developer (in fact, this is my first React project!).

- I originally started as a Systems Engineer working on legacy Windows systems, most of the job revolved around software maintenance and system health checks, etc.

- After completing my part-time Bachelor of Computer Science (Digital Systems Security) with University of Wollongong, I embarked on my journey to become a software developer.

- However, I realized I still prefer to be working on systems (and now infrastructure) at some point in my career, so there you go! 

- I am definitely not the smartest or best engineer around, but I'll be sure to impress with my quick and precise Googling (Or DuckDuckGo, if you will) skills.

## What is this?
- This is my first (actually, second) attempt at writing a portfolio website, I always thought it was good to host my own site, though this turned out to be a fairly mediocre implementation.

- This page is a really generic and informal introduction, for more important information, look at the next section, or select the files on the left to get started!

## How do I navigate?
- This website is meant as a replication of your generic text editor (I tried to use VSC as a reference).

- Select the files on the left to look at relevant information, change views by selecting the tabs, you know the drill :)

- Some other quick shortcuts on the left - my LinkedIn profile, Github, quick `mailto` shortcut, and a PDF copy of my resume.

- I wrote this website as a form of practice during my free time, really.
